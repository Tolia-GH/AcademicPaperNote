### Abstract 摘要
In the past years, the computer vision domain has been profoundly changed by the advent of deep learning algorithms and data science. The defect detection problem is of outmost importance in high-tech industries such as aerospace manufacturing and is extensively employed using automated industrial quality control systems. Defect inspection methods can be mainly grouped into manual inspection, traditional computer vision, and modern computer vision inspection. Initially developed two decades ago, the CNN algorithms recently became popular for solving complex machine vision problems, as big datasets and computationally potent hardware became widely available. Deep learning-based methods form the foundation for modern automatic optical in spection methods and can be grouped based on their network connections into two categories: dense networks and sparse networks. Another method for grouping considers the type of learning: supervised learning used primarily for defect classification and segmentation, and unsupervised learning models, which have the potential to overcome the challenges of supervised models such as labeling images and annotating pixels. In addition, pixel-level based segmentation techniques are considered to cover the state-of-the-art methodologies for the automatic optical inspection. Still, both supervised and unsupervised models pose challenges in regards to model training and attaining the expected detection accuracy. Identified open challenges include algorithmic, application, and data processing challenges. By addressing these challenges, in the future, the demand for automated optical inspection is expected to only grow in both industry practice and academic research.  
在过去的几年里，深度学习的出现深刻地改变了计算机视觉领域算法和数据科学。缺陷检测问题在高科技行业中至关重要，例如作为航空航天制造，广泛使用自动化工业质量控制系统。缺陷检测方法主要可分为人工检测、传统计算机视觉和现代计算机视觉检查。 CNN 算法最初是二十年前开发的，最近已成为用于解决复杂的机器视觉问题，如大数据集和计算能力强的硬件变得广泛可用。基于深度学习的方法构成了现代自动光学检测方法的基础，可以根据其网络连接分为两类： 密集网络和稀疏网络。另一种分组方法考虑学习类型：使用监督学习主要用于缺陷分类和分割，以及无监督学习模型，具有潜力克服监督模型的挑战，例如标记图像和注释像素。此外，基于像素级的分割技术被认为涵盖了最先进的方法自动光学检查。尽管如此，有监督和无监督模型都对模型提出了挑战训练并达到预期的检测精度。已确定的开放挑战包括算法、应用程序和数据处理挑战。通过应对这些挑战，未来对自动化的需求光学检测预计只会在行业实践和学术研究方面有所增长。
